### **[0:00-0:30] Introduction & Problem Statement**

**"Hi! Today I'm presenting our Payroll Escrow System - a blockchain solution that protects both employers and employees.**

**The Problem**: When employees are terminated, they often face financial uncertainty. Companies might delay severance payments, and employees have no guarantee of fair treatment.

**Our Solution**: A smart contract-based payroll system with automatic escrow deposits and duration-based severance protection. Built on Ethereum, deployed on Sepolia testnet."
